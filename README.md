# Neoantigen Prediction Pipeline
  * Author: Nina Song
  
## Overview of the Project
  * Acccumulating abberrations in tumor cells lead to present tumor-specific mutabt peptides (neoantigens) on MHC molecules on their surface, which can distinguish tumor cells from normal cells to the immune system and are thus targets for cancer immunotherapy. Technology Platfroms and algorithms enable indentification of tumor neoantigens, such as the use of next-generation Sequencing to screen the exome and transcriptome of a tumor. The process of neoantigen identification entails indentification of tumor-specific protein sequnces and prioritization of candidate neoantigens according to their abundance, presence on patient HLA molecules and ability to elicit a T-cell response.

  * In this project, a computational pipeline, pVACseq, is used to predict the neoantigens present in melanoma with a focus on high-throughput sequencing data. Personalized Variant Antigens by Can cer Sequencing (pVAC-Seq) is a flexible, streamlined computational workflow for identification of neoantigens that integrates tumor mutation and expression data (DNA- and RNA-seq). pVAC-seq is available at https://github.com/griffithlab/pVAC-Seq.
